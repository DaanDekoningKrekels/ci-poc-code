### 1. PCB Testing:

| Step                                           | Test result                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Maintainer    |

| 1. Soldering PCB<br/><br/>Done by: Daan + Birk | The regulator that was used on the PCB is a different regulator than what the PCB was designed for, it has a different pinout. If the regulator is rotated by 240ยบ the pinout will be correct. <br/>(fig. 1.1)          | Daan<br/>Birk |
| 2. Microcontroller<br/><br/>Done by: Daan      | The microcontroller has been confirmed to be working using Atmel Studio 7 and Atmel-ICE programmer. <br/>(fig 1.2.1 + fig 1.2.2)                                                                                        | Daan          |
| 3. LoraWAN<br/><br/>Done by: Birk              | The RN2483 has been confirmed to be working as expected by using an external Arduino to read the UART of the RN2483.<br/>The RN2483 has connected to TheThingsNetwork and has sucessfully sent test data.<br/>(fig 1.3) | Birk          |
| 4. UART and I2C<br/><br/>Done by: Birk + Daan  | Sending over UART works.<br/>Reading the UART does not work as expected yet.<br/>I2C has not been tested yet.                                                                                                           | Birk<br/>Daan |
| 5. Attach sensors                              | Not yet tested                                                                                                                                                                                                          | /             |

### 2. PCB Programming:

We have two different programers, an Atmel-ICE and a J-Link. We will be using the Atmel-ICE.

##### 2.1 Atmel-ICE:

| Step                                           | Test result                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Maintainer |

| 1. Connecting Atmel-ICE<br/><br/>Done by: Birk | An ARM-JTAG 20-10 ADAPTER by olimex was used to connect the Atmel-ICE to the programming headers on the PCB. The adapter can be found here together with some shematics: https://www.olimex.com/Products/ARM/JTAG/ARM-JTAG-20-10/                                                                                                                                  | Birk       |
| 2. Atmel START<br/><br/>Done by: Daan          | The Atmel START file was configured step by step. <br/>1. The SAMD21 was configured to work with the internal clock<br/>2. The UART was configured and tested by reading Hello World from the UART pins (fig 2.3.1)<br/>3. The external 32K Hz oscillator was configured (fig 2.3.2)<br/>4. Atlast the rest of the pins and the RN2483 were configured (fig 2.3.3) | Daan       |
| 3. RN2483<br/><br/>Done by: Birk               | UART has been confirmed to be working as expected in step 2.<br/>The RN2483 uses UART as an interface to send commands. What has to be done in this step is figuring out a way to read the UART from the RN2483 using the SAMD21 and not an external arduino.                                                                                                      | Birk       |
